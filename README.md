ðŸ’š Welcome to [Green Webhook](https://greenwebhook.netlify.app/)! ðŸ’š

Green Webhook is a proxy or gateway between two systems that intelligently chooses which endpoint to send a webhook event to in order to location shift compute workloads to the endpoint with the lowest carbon intensity. It uses the [Carbon Aware SDK](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk) to check the impact of an increased demand on the electricity grid for the relevant locations.

By deploying your workload to multiple regions and configuring each endpoint along with its location within a Green Webhook you can reduce the carbon emissions caused by your workload.

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Green Webhook is built with Redwood and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=14.19.x <=16.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 where you'll see the Welcome Page, which links out to a ton of great resources.

> **The Redwood CLI**
>
> Congratulations on running your first Redwood CLI command!
> From dev to deploy, the CLI is with you the whole way.
> And there's quite a few commands at your disposal:
> ```
> yarn redwood --help
> ```
> For all the details, see the [CLI reference](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands).

## Prisma and the database

Redwood wouldn't be a full-stack framework without a database. It all starts with the schema. Open the [`schema.prisma`](api/db/schema.prisma) file in `api/db` and replace the `UserExample` model with the following `Post` model:

```
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Redwood uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a next-gen Node.js and TypeScript ORM, to talk to the database. Prisma's schema offers a declarative way of defining your app's data models. And Prisma [Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate) uses that schema to make database migrations hassle-free:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev

# ...

? Enter a name for the new migration: â€º create posts
```

> `rw` is short for `redwood`

You'll be prompted for the name of your migration. `create posts` will do.

Now let's generate everything we need to perform all the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on our `Post` model:

```
yarn redwood g scaffold post
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8910/posts/new, fill in the title and body, and click "Save":

Did we just create a post in the database? Yup! With `yarn rw g scaffold <model>`, Redwood created all the pages, components, and services necessary to perform all CRUD actions on our posts table.

## Frontend first with Storybook

Don't know what your data models look like?
That's more than okâ€”Redwood integrates Storybook so that you can work on design without worrying about data.
Mockup, build, and verify your React components, even in complete isolation from the backend:

```
yarn rw storybook
```

Before you start, see if the CLI's `setup ui` command has your favorite styling library:

```
yarn rw setup ui --help
```

## Testing with Jest

It'd be hard to scale from side project to startup without a few tests.
Redwood fully integrates Jest with the front and the backends and makes it easy to keep your whole app covered by generating test files with all your components and services:

```
yarn rw test
```

To make the integration even more seamless, Redwood augments Jest with database [scenarios](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing.md#scenarios)  and [GraphQL mocking](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing.md#mocking-graphql-calls).

## Ship it

Redwood is designed for both serverless deploy targets like Netlify and Vercel and serverful deploy targets like Render and AWS:

```
yarn rw setup deploy --help
```

Don't go live without auth!
Lock down your front and backends with Redwood's built-in, database-backed authentication system ([dbAuth](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication#self-hosted-auth-installation-and-setup)), or integrate with nearly a dozen third party auth providers:

```
yarn rw setup auth --help
```

# Examples

## Create a webhook that runs code on your laptop via ngrok

1. Create a NextJS app by running `npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/api-routes-starter"`
2. Create `pages/api/user.js` with:

```js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
}
```
3. In a terminal run `npm run dev`
4. Install Ngrok from https://ngrok.com/
5. In a terminal run `ngrok http 3000`
6. Copy the URL output by Ngrok and add `/api/user` to the end
7. Log in to https://greenwebhook.netlify.app and create a new webhook.
8. Paste the URL from step 6 into the destination.
9. Click Save
10. Click on the `Invocation URI` link to trigger the webhook.
11. Confirm that the response is `200` and contains JSON `{ name: "John Doe" }`

Currently the Carbon Aware SDK only supports a limited list of locations but when more locations are supported then we will be able to allow you to put in the location where your computer or laptop is running in order to determine if it is the location with the lowest carbon intensity.
